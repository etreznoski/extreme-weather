### Project Description:
    Determine patterns in wildfire events in the state of California from 2010-2019. 
We'll examine relationships between frequency of these events and the economic impact 
through census data. Our data will be analyzed and segmented into counties and by years; 
trend of any economic changes surrounding wildfire events location and time. 
    
### Research Questions to Answer:
    * Possible drought correlation with wildfires
    * Population comparison and extreme weather events (extreme cold in less populated area vs more populated?)
    * California severe weather events, could then compare with other states
    * Comparing income level (poverty level) to economic impact of severe weather events
    * Crop and property damage comparison for counties for high or most severe weather events
### Datasets to Be Used:
