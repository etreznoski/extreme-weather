Multiple downhill and cross country ski resorts were forced to close due to a lack of snow. Resorts which remained open were forced to produce artificial snow, and scale back the number of runs open. Other winter activities such as snowmobiling and snow shoeing were also greatly affected by the lack of snow pack. Restaurants and hotels in the area which rely on winter tourism suffered a significant drop in business.||Many farmers are already planning to scale back crop planting acreage due to decreased irrigation water allocations again in 2015.","After a wet December for most of the area, January returned to an extremely dry pattern with the California drought continuing in full force. This was the driest January on record for the state, with many locations receiving little or no precipitation for what is on average the wettest month of the year. Snow pack in the mountains was extremely low, about 25% of normal. |Extreme drought was detected by the U.S. Drought Monitor across the region, with exceptional drought for the northern San Joaquin Valley, the central and southern Sacramento Valley, the Burney Basin and the Sierra south of Interstate 80.  |Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the entire state of California January 17, 2014 and this continued to be in effect. |Impacts to the region for January included strong conservation efforts within most communities, a significant decrease in the snow-related tourism activity in the Northern Sierra Nevada, reduction in air quality due to persistent stagnant air, and a reduction of ground water resources which are replacing diminished reservoir water.",1

Increased water conservation measures were passed by the state to increase reductions further by limiting water use for lawn watering and added incentives to limit water use in hotels and restaurants  There was a continued reduction of ground water resources which are being used to replace diminished reservoir water. Agricultural impacts included orchard reduction, limits on planting and increased costs due to reliance on groundwater. Sutter County alone has lost an estimated 1100 agriculture related jobs. The Lake Don Pedro Community (La Grange and Coulterville)  adopted mandatory water conservation measures and water use restrictions effective March 9th due to the drought emergency and severe lack of water supply in Lake McClure, which is expected to go dry this summer.","An extremely dry March followed a below normal February for most areas. This continued the 4th consecutive year of drought for the region. Mountain snowfall was very limited for the month. This along with record warmth over the area resulted in the lowest snow pack levels on record for the time of year. By the end of March, the snow pack was only about 5 percent of normal levels. Melting snow pack supplies about a third of the annual water supply for California.

Governor Brown ordered mandatory restrictions of 25 percent statewide, the first time such mandatory restrictions have been enacted.||Agriculture has been heavily impacted, with numerous farm and farm related jobs lost.

There were 228 in Stanislaus County, 10 in San Joaquin County, unchanged since June. Many communities in the Northern San Joaquin Valley were still receiving food assistance as a direct result of the drought.","Long term drought impacts continued through the month of July, although some of the largest of the reservoirs in northern interior California were around normal levels. While there was a better snow pack for the mountains over the wet season, very warm weather caused the snow to melt and run off quickly in the spring. This caused peak reservoir levels to occur earlier than expected. By the end of July, all but Lake Shasta and Don Pedro were dropping off faster than normal. Lake Shasta was 110% of normal by the end of the month, Lake Oroville was 90%, Folsom Lake was 70%, and Don Pedro was 94%. New Melones continued to lag behind the other significant area reservoirs and was only 40% of normal.||The U.S. Drought Monitor showed no change from June for the area, with severe drought across the southern Sacramento Valley; the northern and central Sacramento Valley and the northern Sierra in moderate drought, while Shasta County was abnormally dry. The remainder of the Central and northern portion of the Southern Sierra Nevada mountain areas remained in the severe to extreme drought. There remained extreme drought in the Sierra south of Highway 50. ||Groundwater aquifers continued to recharge much more slowly than the surface reservoirs, with many in the Central Valley still falling toward record levels. Growers in the San Joaquin Valley continued to turn to groundwater with reduced surface water allocations. This heavy reliance on groundwater resulted in declining water levels. ||Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the entire state of California January 17, 2014 and this continued to be in effect. Governor Brown issued an executive order on May 9, 2016 that built on temporary statewide emergency water restrictions to establish longer-term water conservation measures, including permanent monthly water use reporting, new permanent water use standards in California communities and banned clearly wasteful practices such as hosing off sidewalks, driveways and other hardscapes. ||Local Emergency proclamations remained for Colusa, Calaveras, El Dorado, Glenn, Plumas, San Joaquin, Shasta, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tuolumne, and Yuba counties. The cities of Live Oak (Sutter County), Lodi (San Joaquin County), Manteca (San Joaquin County), Portola (Plumas County), Ripon (San Joaquin County), and West Sacramento (Yolo County). Drought task forces remain in Lake, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Tuolumne, and Yolo counties to coordinate response to the drought. ||Mandatory water reductions of 25% as ordered by Governor Brown were suspended in May due to the improved reservoir levels, with voluntary reductions requested. Water conservation was reported as about the same as the 21.5% savings for the month of June 2016, although it was down from 31% in July 2015. ||The state continued to supply food assistance to those impacted by the drought, along with California Disaster Assistance Act money for those who have lost drinking water due to dry wells. Nonprofit organizations in the San Joaquin Valley struggled to meet the needs of their clients for drought-related programs. ||Tree mortality from drought and resulting bark beetle infestation continued to increase both in scale and intensity, especially in low elevation pine and oak woodlands along the Sierra Nevada Range. A US Forest Service- Forest Health Protection aerial survey showed tree mortality was especially high in the Stanislaus National Forest southward, though pockets of tree mortality were present as far north as eastern Shasta County. Tree mortality from the recent years of drought has been estimated at 66 million trees across California. This increase in dead and dying trees made the forest more susceptible to wildfires.||Drought conditions are blamed for an increase in blue-green algae across Northern California lakes. These algae can produce cyanotoxins, which in high enough concentrations can potentially cause allergic reactions, skin irritation, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, joint pain, liver damage and even cancer in people and pets swimming in the water.",319

The threat of dead or dying trees continued, with on-going tree-removal programs at the state and federal level. ||The state continued to supply food assistance to those impacted by the drought, along with California Disaster Assistance Act money for those who have lost drinking water due to dry wells.",405
